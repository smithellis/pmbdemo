# What's here:

Presented with two tests, I took a stab at both.

Under scripts/junior are the first test scripts (and a scratchpad file where I was testing)

Under scripts/senior is the command line script for the senior test, complete with some aruba/cucumber tests

Under webapp/pmbtest is a rails application in progress as part of the senior test

# What's not done

The rails app isn't completed.  Models exist and seem right, I've skinned the application and made a default route, but there aren't specific views yet that enforce relationships or show sorted output.
